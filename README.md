As I am student of 42 MÃ¡laga, I spent 1 week doing the "discovery web piscine", that foment knowledge about HTML, CSS, JS and JQuery

I had some previous level of web developement before doing it so I could complete it

CELL0 -> Shell
CELL1 -> HTML
CELL2 -> CSS
CELL3 -> JS-JQUERY
RUSH -> WEB CV WITH JQuery
